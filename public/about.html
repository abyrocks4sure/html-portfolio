    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am Abhishek Pradhan, affectionately known as Aby, a passionate and experienced Robotics Instructor at Robochamps, Brightchamps. With a robust background in data science, I am currently honing my skills in Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and other advanced technologies.</p>

    <p>My journey began as an assistant teacher in an English medium school where I taught computer subjects to middle school students. This experience laid a strong foundation for my teaching career, which has now evolved to focus on integrating technology and education.</p>

    <p>I am enthusiastic about developing innovative educational tools, such as an affordable EEG DIY kit for kids. This project aims to make brainwave analysis accessible and engaging, fostering a deeper understanding of brain functions through interactive mind games.</p>

    <p>In addition to my teaching endeavors, I enjoy creating small projects using microcontrollers like Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi. These projects allow me to blend creativity with technical expertise, continuously pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.</p>

    <p>Looking ahead, I am dedicated to mastering machine learning and artificial intelligence. I aspire to participate in Kaggle competitions and achieve recognition through my contributions to the data science community. Moreover, I plan to engage in freelancing, leveraging my skills to take on diverse and challenging projects.</p>

    <p>Beyond my professional life, I am a proud husband and father, residing in Midnapore, West Bengal. I am excited about the future and the endless possibilities that lie ahead in the realm of technology and education.</p>
